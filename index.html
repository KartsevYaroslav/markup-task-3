            Mnuchin Highlights Ties to Saudis After Journalist's Killing
        </h2>
        <article>
            U.S. Treas&shyur&shyy Sec&shyre&shyta&shyry Ste&shyven Mnuchin em&shypha&shysized the
            im&shypor&shytance of the U.S.’s e&shyco&shynom&shyic
            ties with Saudi A&shyra&shybi&shya, re&shyin&shyforc&shying the pri&shyor&shyi&shyties the Trump
            ad&shymin&shyis&shytra&shytion set af&shyter Saudi jour&shynal&shyist Jamal Khashoggi, a
            crit&shyic of the king&shydom’s lead&shyer&shyship, was killed in&shyside its Is&shytan&shybul
            con&shysu&shylate.

            <span class="quote">“We have a long&shystand&shying re&shyla&shytion&shyship with Saudi that
            dates back to a long pe&shyri&shyod of time,” Mnuchin said
            to re&shyport&shyers in Je&shyru&shysa&shylem, the first stop on a six&shycoun&shytry Mid&shydle
            East swing that will in&shyclude a vis&shyit
            to Ri&shyyadh. “We will con&shytin&shyue in that re&shyla&shytion&shyship while we al&shyso
            si&shymul&shyta&shyne&shyous&shyly get to the bot&shytom of what
                the facts are a&shybout the Khashoggi sit&shyu&shya&shytion, which ob&shyvi&shyous&shyly is a ter&shyri&shyble sit&shyu&shya&shytion.”</span>
            The Treas&shyur&shyy chief ― who has can&shyceled his par&shytic&shyi&shypa&shytion in a Saudi
            in&shyvest&shyment con&shyfer&shyence this week ―
            said
            that while the world seeks an&shyswers as to what hap&shypened to Khashoggi,
            <span class="quote">“the information that’s coming out is a
            good first step, but it’s obviously not enough.”</span>

            More than two weeks af&shyter Khashoggi dis&shyap&shypeared, the king&shydom ac&shyknowl&shyedged
            o&shyver the week&shyend that the
            Wash&shying&shyton Post con&shytrib&shyu&shytor was killed in&shyside the con&shysu&shylate and
            char&shyac&shyter&shyized his death as
            ac&shyci&shyden&shytal.
            That
            ac&shycount con&shyflicts with re&shyports by Turk&shyish of&shyfi&shycials that a Saudi hit team
            flew in
            specifical&shyly to kill
            and
            then dis&shymem&shyber him, and a New York Times re&shyport that some mem&shybers of the group had
            close
            ties to Saudi
            Crown
            Prince Mo&shyham&shymed bin Salman.

            A Tanzanian bil&shylion&shyaire in&shydus&shytri&shyal&shyist who was ab&shyduct&shyed a&shybout
            nine days a&shygo was re&shyleased un&shyharmed,
            as
            po&shylice
            said they’re hunt&shying for the per&shype&shytra&shytors of the crime that threat&shyened to
            spook in&shyves&shytors in East
            Af&shyri&shyca’s
            sec&shyond&shylarg&shyest e&shycon&shyo&shymy.

            Mo&shyham&shymed Dewji, list&shyed by Forbes as Af&shyri&shyca’s young&shyest
            bil&shylion&shyaire with a net worth of $1.5 bil&shylion,
            was
            dropped off in an ar&shye&shya of Da&shyr es Sa&shylaam, Tan&shyza&shyni&shya’s main cit&shyy, by
            his kid&shynap&shypers, po&shylice In&shyspec&shytor
            Gen&shyer&shyal
            Si&shymon Sirro said Sat&shyur&shyday.


            The Mo Dewji Foun&shyda&shytion, a char&shyi&shyty es&shytab&shylished by the bil&shylion&shyaire,
            an&shynounced his re&shylease ear&shyly
            Sat&shyur&shyday. In
            a Twit&shyter post, it quot&shyed Dewji thank&shying <span class="quote">
            “the authorities of Tanzania, including the police force for
            working for my safe return.”</span>
            The 43&shyyear&shyold was seized by un&shyi&shyden&shyti&shyfied peo&shyple in the Tanzanian
            com&shymer&shycial hub of Da&shyr es Sa&shylaam
            on
            Oct.
            11. It was the lat&shyest wor&shyry&shying turn for Tan&shyza&shyni&shya, once de&shyscribed as an
            “is&shyland of peace” in a
            tur&shybu&shylent
            re&shygion, but that has seen a re&shycent spate of po&shylit&shyi&shycal&shyly
            mo&shyti&shyvat&shyed vi&shyo&shylence.

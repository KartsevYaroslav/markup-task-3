            Mnuchin Highlights Ties to Saudis After Journalist's Killing
        </h2>
        <article>
            U.S. Treas&shy;ur&shy;y Sec&shy;re&shy;ta&shy;ry Ste&shy;ven Mnuchin em&shy;pha&shy;sized
            the
            im&shy;por&shy;tance of the U.S.’s e&shy;co&shy;nom&shy;ic
            ties with Saudi A&shy;ra&shy;bi&shy;a, re&shy;in&shy;forc&shy;ing the pri&shy;or&shy;i&shy;ties
            the Trump
            ad&shy;min&shy;is&shy;tra&shy;tion set af&shy;ter Saudi jour&shy;nal&shy;ist Jamal
            Khashoggi, a
            crit&shy;ic of the king&shy;dom’s lead&shy;er&shy;ship, was killed in&shy;side its
            Is&shy;tan&shy;bul
            con&shy;su&shy;late.

            <span class="quote">“We have a long&shy;stand&shy;ing re&shy;la&shy;tion&shy;ship with Saudi that
            dates back to a long pe&shy;ri&shy;od of time,” Mnuchin said
            to re&shy;port&shy;ers in Je&shy;ru&shy;sa&shy;lem, the first stop on a six&shy;coun&shy;try
                Mid&shy;dle
            East swing that will in&shy;clude a vis&shy;it
            to Ri&shy;yadh. “We will con&shy;tin&shy;ue in that re&shy;la&shy;tion&shy;ship while we al&shy;so
            si&shy;mul&shy;ta&shy;ne&shy;ous&shy;ly get to the bot&shy;tom of what
                the facts are a&shy;bout the Khashoggi sit&shy;u&shy;a&shy;tion, which
                ob&shy;vi&shy;ous&shy;ly is a ter&shy;ri&shy;ble sit&shy;u&shy;a&shy;tion.”</span>
            The Treas&shy;ur&shy;y chief ― who has can&shy;celed his par&shy;tic&shy;i&shy;pa&shy;tion
            in a
            Saudi
            in&shy;vest&shy;ment con&shy;fer&shy;ence this week ―
            said
            that while the world seeks an&shy;swers as to what hap&shy;pened to Khashoggi,
            <span class="quote">“the information that’s coming out is a
            good first step, but it’s obviously not enough.”</span>

            More than two weeks af&shy;ter Khashoggi dis&shy;ap&shy;peared, the
            king&shy;dom ac&shy;knowl&shy;edged
            o&shy;ver the week&shy;end that the
            Wash&shy;ing&shy;ton Post con&shy;trib&shy;u&shy;tor was killed in&shy;side
            the con&shy;su&shy;late
            and
            char&shy;ac&shy;ter&shy;ized his death as
            ac&shy;ci&shy;den&shy;tal.
            That
            ac&shy;count con&shy;flicts with re&shy;ports by Turk&shy;ish of&shy;fi&shy;cials that a
            Saudi hit
            team
            flew in
            specifical&shy;ly to kill
            and
            then dis&shy;mem&shy;ber him, and a New York Times re&shy;port that some mem&shy;bers of
            the group
            had
            close
            ties to Saudi
            Crown
            Prince Mo&shy;ham&shy;med bin Salman.

            A Tanzanian bil&shy;lion&shy;aire in&shy;dus&shy;tri&shy;al&shy;ist who was ab&shy;duct&shy;ed
            a&shy;bout
            nine days a&shy;go was re&shy;leased un&shy;harmed,
            as
            po&shy;lice
            said they’re hunt&shy;ing for the per&shy;pe&shy;tra&shy;tors of the crime that threat&shy;ened
            to
            spook in&shy;ves&shy;tors in East
            Af&shy;ri&shy;ca’s
            sec&shy;ond&shy;larg&shy;est e&shy;con&shy;o&shy;my.

            Mo&shy;ham&shy;med Dewji, list&shy;ed by Forbes as Af&shy;ri&shy;ca’s young&shy;est
            bil&shy;lion&shy;aire with a net worth of $1.5 bil&shy;lion,
            was
            dropped off in an ar&shy;e&shy;a of Da&shy;r es Sa&shy;laam, Tan&shy;za&shy;ni&shy;a’s
            main cit&shy;y,
            by

            Gen&shy;er&shy;al
            Si&shy;mon Sirro said Sat&shy;ur&shy;day.

            The Mo Dewji Foun&shy;da&shy;tion, a char&shy;i&shy;ty es&shy;tab&shy;lished by the
            bil&shy;lion&shy;aire,
            an&shy;nounced his re&shy;lease ear&shy;ly
            Sat&shy;ur&shy;day. In
            a Twit&shy;ter post, it quot&shy;ed Dewji thank&shy;ing <span class="quote">
            “the authorities of Tanzania, including the police force for
            working for my safe return.”</span>
            The 43&shy;year&shy;old was seized by un&shy;i&shy;den&shy;ti&shy;fied peo&shy;ple in
            the
            Tanzanian
            com&shy;mer&shy;cial hub of Da&shy;r es Sa&shy;laam
            on
            Oct.
            11. It was the lat&shy;est wor&shy;ry&shy;ing turn for Tan&shy;za&shy;ni&shy;a, once
            de&shy;scribed
            as an
            “is&shy;land of peace” in a
            tur&shy;bu&shy;lent
            re&shy;gion, but that has seen a re&shy;cent spate of po&shy;lit&shy;i&shy;cal&shy;ly
            mo&shy;ti&shy;vat&shy;ed vi&shy;o&shy;lence.

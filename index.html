        Mnuchin Highlights Ties to Saudis After Journalist's Killing
    </h2>
    <article lang="en">
        U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin emphasized the importance of the U.S.’s economic ties with
        Saudi
        Arabia, reinforcing the priorities the Trump administration set after Saudi journalist Jamal
        Khashoggi,
        a critic of the kingdom’s leadership, was killed inside its Istanbul consulate.

        <span class="quote">“We have a longstanding relationship with Saudi that
            dates back to a long period of time,” Mnuchin said
            to reporters in Jerusalem, the first stop on a six-country Middle
            East swing that will include a visit
            to Riyadh. “We will continue in that relationship while we also
            simultaneously get to the bottom of what
                the facts are about the Khashoggi situation, which obviously is a terrible situation.”</span>

        The Treasury chief -- who has canceled his participation in a Saudi
        investment conference this week --
        said
        that while the world seeks answers as to what happened to Khashoggi,
        <span class="quote">“the information that’s coming out is a
            good first step, but it’s obviously not enough.”</span>

        More than two weeks after Khashoggi disappeared, the kingdom acknowledged over the weekend that the
        Washington Post contributor was killed inside the consulate and characterized his death as accidental.
        That
        account conflicts with reports by Turkish officials that a Saudi hit team flew in specifically to kill
        and
        then dismember him, and a New York Times report that some members of the group had close ties to Saudi
        Crown
        Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

        Africa's Youngest Billionaire Freed as Police Pursue Kidnappers
    </h2>
    <article lang="en">
        A Tanzanian billionaire industrialist who was abducted about nine days ago was released unharmed, as
        police
        said they’re hunting for the perpetrators of the crime that threatened to spook investors in East
        Africa’s
        second-largest economy.

        Mohammed Dewji, listed by Forbes as Africa’s youngest
        billionaire with a net worth of $1.5 billion,
        was
        dropped off in an area of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania’s main city, by his kidnappers, police Inspector
        General
        Simon Sirro said Saturday.

        <h3><img src="https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ioId8T2yZ3bM/v1/1000x-1.jpg"
                 alt="person">
            Dewji’s family offered almost $500,000 as a reward for information that led to his rescue.</h3>
        The Mo Dewji Foundation, a charity established by the billionaire, announced his release early
        Saturday. In
        a Twitter post, it quoted Dewji thanking <span class="quote">
        “the authorities of Tanzania, including the police force for
        working for my safe return.”</span>

        The 43-year-old was seized by unidentified people in the Tanzanian commercial hub of Dar es Salaam on
        Oct.
        11. It was the latest worrying turn for Tanzania, once described as an “island of peace” in a
        turbulent
        region, but that has seen a recent spate of politically motivated violence.
